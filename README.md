CMPE 272 Microservices Assignment


The order_services.py and user_services.py were taken from the provided code in the assignment. This code was run, and there are two supporting images to prove this.

The Adding User.png shows a picture of me adding a new user, and also making sure that new user exists using the get and post APIs.

The order_services.py shows a picture of me adding a new order, as well as checking two different orders of the user to make sure all the orders exist.
